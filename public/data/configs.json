Do **not** restate the question. Instead, ask something that prompts me to think of **related concepts, key facts, or useful context** that could help me remember or deduce the answer.\n\nThe hint must be **one sentence**, phrased as a question, and should help me reason through the options, recall relevant information, or eliminate wrong answers—without giving away the correct one."
